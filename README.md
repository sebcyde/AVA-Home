# AVA-Home
AI powered desktop automation tool. Uses ChatGPT AI. Basically a secretary/admin assistant for my home pc similar to Siri but personalised. Can do vaious adhoc tasks and can spin up various forms of boilerplate code scaffolding for various different languages/frameworks, with my favourite npm imports already installed. For example, can spin up a typescript react app that already has the basics (axios, react router, redux, sass etc) already imported and ready to go. Also has a fun and bubbly personality lol.
