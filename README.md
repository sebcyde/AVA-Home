# AVA-Home
AI powered desktop automation tool. Uses ChatGPT AI. Basically a secretary/admin assistant for my home pc similar to Siri but personalised. 

# Usage
Can be accessed from any Git Bash terminal using the command 'ava' and can do various adhoc tasks such as creating various forms of boilerplate code scaffolding for various different languages/frameworks, with my favourite npm imports already installed. For example, can spin up a typescript react app that already has the basics (axios, react router, redux, sass etc) already imported and ready to go. Also has a fun and bubbly personality lol.
