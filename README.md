Home Desktop Automation Tool.
Basically spins up various forms of boilerplate code scaffolding for various different languages/frameworks, with my favourite npm imports already installed.
For example, can spin up a typescript react app that already has the basics (axios, react router, redux, sass etc) already imported and ready to go.
Still a work in progress.
